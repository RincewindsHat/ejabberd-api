# TODO for ejabberd API library

ejabberd command-line:

- Add prompt for password on oauth token generation with -P
- Add to README.md: Configuration added to ejabberd config file
- Add option for controling token expiration / duration.
- Refactor code to streamline the workflow / avoid duplication of processing between structure oauthToken and file.
  Oauthtoken should be probably serializable as is.
